This is achieved through maximising the benefits of EDItechnology which facilitates direct flow of communication between the agentnetworks representing the 5000 retail outlets. EDI information allowsBenetton manufacturers to delay the dyeing process up until a clearunderstanding is reached on market requirements. This eliminates the buildup of wasteful inventories, thereby reducing costs, slashing cycle times andmaximising efficiencies. Once this information is relayed to the centre,Benetton is able to arrange bulk delivery of products from its regionaldistribution centres which are highly automated and thus able to cope withdemand.

This is achieved through the effective usage of 500 sub-contractors who work in the vicinity of the companies HQ and productionbase. The sub-contractor group, often themselves former Benettonmanagers, organise the second tier of small factories who undertake thelabour-intensive processes (Skjott- Larsen\n",
      "et al \n",
      "2007: 95-96). A pyramidanalogy has been used to describe the hierarchical nature of this relationship,with Benetton at the apex, the sub-contractors forming the second tier andthe army of small workshops forming the bottom layer (Harrison 1993: 160)Benetton directly controls the supply of raw materials thereby achieving costsavings in supplier overheads. It has a very close relationship with the sub-contractor base, thus ensuring that the factories under their control are ableto satisfy market trends at short notice. This is a distinct advantage to theircompetitors who do not enjoy such flexibility and are hampered with fixed-cost overheads (Skjott-Larsen et al 2007:97).Consider the following statistic: in 1990 90% of Benetton garments wereproduced in Italy. Now it is only 30% and within a few years it is expected tofall to only 10% (Economist: 8 February 2007). Such is the dramatic impactof globalisation. Benetton has responded by remaining true to its philosophyof tight central control by replicating its Treviso production model on a globalbasis. For instance Benetton Hungary has production oversight of 7 countrieswithin the region (Camuffo\n",
      "et al \n",
      "2001: 49). This is in keeping with theunderlying company philosophy of creating global brands which transcendnational boundaries.\n",
      "How well do these three interconnecting sets of operations fit together? \n",
      "For decades Benetton has consistently demonstrated that getting the rightmix of the 3 supply chain functions is critical if market success is to beachieved. Its franchise network has proved to be adept at communicatingcritical market trend information via its EDI system to HQ who alerts themanufacturing side to the real-time needs of the market. Use of sophisticatedCAD/ CAM technology has enabled Benetton to gain the upper hand on itscompetitors by being quick and flexible at this point in the production process(Dapiran 1992:9-10.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "Benetton has successfully exploited I.T. advantages from an early stage. ItsGeis global integrated network has enabled agents to forward customer orderdetails to the 500 sub-contractors based in the Veneto heartland where thecompany manufacturing capability has historically been located. Within daysthey are able to receive multiple orders from various country agents andrapidly set in motion the manufacturing work by fully exploiting the vastnetwork of sub-contracted labour. The system is also connected to Benettonmanufacturing plants worldwide (Johnston 1994: 2-3).\n",

Some employees will have been working from home while others may have been home on furlough. You need to understand how motivated people are to return to the office ‚Äì whether that‚Äôs because they‚Äôve enjoyed working from home or because they are disappointed by the decision to furlough them. We‚Äôve put together a list of questions to help you understand how your employees are feeling about returning to work.\n",
